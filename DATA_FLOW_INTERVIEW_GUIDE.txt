## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (1 minute)

### Two-Part System:
1. **Python ML Pipeline** - Trains models offline
2. **JavaScript Chrome Extension** - Real-time browser analysis

### Key Technologies:
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training models
- **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency - converts text to numerical features
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple models (Logistic Regression + Naive Bayes) for better accuracy
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: JavaScript APIs for web page interaction

## 🔄 DATA FLOW

### TRAINING PHASE (Offline - Python)

**1. Data Input**
- 4,403 labeled news articles (fake/real)
- Source: Academic research dataset from 2016 election

**2. Text Preprocessing**
```
Raw Text → Clean Text → Features
"BREAKING: Miracle cure!" → "breaking miracle cure" → [0.2, 0.8, 0.1, ...]
```
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **Tokenization**: Split text into words
- **Stopword Removal**: Remove common words ("the", "and")
- **Stemming**: Reduce words to root form ("running" → "run")

**3. Feature Engineering**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text to 25,000 numerical features
  - Term Frequency: How often a word appears in document
  - Inverse Document Frequency: How rare a word is across all documents
  - Formula: TF × IDF = importance score for each word
- **N-grams**: Word combinations (1-word, 2-word, 3-word phrases)
- **Character N-grams**: Letter combinations to catch typos/variations

**4. Model Training**
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear model that outputs probabilities (good for interpretability)
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic model that assumes feature independence (handles small datasets well)
- **Voting Classifier**: Combines both models' predictions for final result
- **Cross-validation**: Tests model on unseen data to prevent overfitting

**5. Browser Optimization**
- **Feature Selection**: Reduce 25,000 features to top 295 most important
- **JSON Serialization**: Convert model to JavaScript-readable format
- Result: 500KB browser model vs 50MB full model

### RUNTIME PHASE (Real-time - JavaScript)

**1. Content Extraction**
```
Webpage → Article Text → Analysis → Result
```
- **DOM Parsing**: Extract article content using CSS selectors
- **Content Filtering**: Remove ads, navigation, comments

**2. Three-Layer Detection System**

**Layer 1: Domain Recognition** (Instant)
- Check URL against known lists:
  - 16 satirical sites (theonion.com, babylonbee.com)
  - 9 conspiracy sites (infowars.com, naturalnews.com)
- If match: Return 95% confidence result immediately

**Layer 2: Pattern Matching** (~5ms)
- **Regular Expressions**: Search for specific text patterns
- 35 satirical patterns: "fucking over", "area man", profanity in headlines
- 47 fake patterns: "miracle cure", "doctors hate", "wake up sheeple"
- 39 real patterns: "according to", "study shows", "researchers found"

**Layer 3: Statistical ML** (~25ms)
- Apply same preprocessing as training
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert text to 295 numerical values
- **Model Inference**: Run through Logistic Regression + Naive Bayes
- **Sigmoid Function**: Convert raw score to probability (0-1)

**3. Result Combination**
- **Weighted Average**: Domain (80%) + Patterns (60%) + ML (40%)
- **Confidence Calculation**: How far probability is from 50% uncertainty
- **Thresholding**: >70% confidence triggers warning banner

## 🔧 KEY TECHNOLOGIES EXPLAINED

### **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **What**: Converts text to numbers for machine learning
- **How**: Important words get higher scores, common words get lower scores
- **Why**: Machines need numbers, not words

### **Ensemble Learning**
- **What**: Combines multiple models instead of using just one
- **How**: Each model votes, final prediction is majority/average
- **Why**: Reduces overfitting, more robust predictions

### **Logistic Regression**
- **What**: Linear model that outputs probabilities instead of categories
- **How**: Draws linear boundary between fake and real news in feature space
- **Why**: Fast, interpretable, works well with text features

### **Naive Bayes**
- **What**: Probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem
- **How**: Calculates probability of fake news given the words present
- **Why**: Works well with small datasets, handles class imbalance

### **Chrome Extension APIs**
- **Content Scripts**: JavaScript that runs on web pages
- **Background Scripts**: Persistent JavaScript for processing
- **Message Passing**: Communication between different extension parts

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### **Browser Constraints Solved:**
1. **Size**: 25,000 → 295 features (50x reduction)
2. **Speed**: Early loop breaks, text truncation for long articles
3. **Memory**: Sparse vectors, garbage collection
4. **Latency**: Local processing (no API calls)

### **Accuracy Maintained:**
- Feature selection keeps most important signals
- Ensemble approach reduces individual model weaknesses
- Domain knowledge compensates for dataset limitations

## 🎯 TECHNICAL CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### **Challenge 1: Dataset Bias**
- **Problem**: Trained on 2016 political news, missed satirical sites
- **Solution**: Added domain recognition layer
- **Result**: Correctly identifies The Onion as satirical

### **Challenge 2: Browser Performance**
- **Problem**: Full model too slow/large for real-time use
- **Solution**: Feature selection + lightweight JSON format
- **Result**: <30ms analysis time, 500KB model size

### **Challenge 3: False Positives**
- **Problem**: Model flags legitimate news as suspicious
- **Solution**: Conservative thresholds + multi-layer validation
- **Result**: High recall (catches fake news) with acceptable precision

## 📊 KEY METRICS
- **Accuracy**: 90.17% on test dataset
- **Speed**: 29ms average processing time
- **Model Size**: 295 features (vs 25,000 original)
- **Coverage**: Satirical, conspiracy, and misinformation detection

## 🎤 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### **Technical Depth:**
"I implemented TF-IDF vectorization with both word and character n-grams to capture semantic meaning and stylistic patterns. The ensemble approach combines logistic regression's interpretability with naive Bayes' robustness to class imbalance."

### **Systems Thinking:**
"The biggest challenge was optimizing for browser constraints while maintaining accuracy. I used feature selection to extract the 295 most predictive features from 25,000 total, reducing model size by 50x with minimal accuracy loss."

### **Real-World Impact:**
"The system correctly identifies The Onion as satirical content through domain recognition, while the ML model catches conspiracy theories and medical misinformation that weren't in the training data through pattern matching."

### **Scalability:**
"Local processing eliminates server costs and scales to millions of users. The modular architecture allows easy model updates, and user feedback enables continuous improvement through active learning."
